**Problem statement**

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

**Task List**

**Learnt things from this Project**

Learnt to build a new card visuals and new interactive thems, which can be utilized for different purpose of analyze.

By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.

Learnt, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and clear filter button in the dashboard was achieved using bookmarks and selection. website like page navigation [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCSYLrcLW00)

Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard [Color palette link](https://colorhunt.co/)

**Some Important insights from the Dashboard**

Mumbai generates highest revenue and Delhi the least revenue during May to Jul 2022. Company need to focus on increasing the revenue in Delhi.

The occupancy rate is higher during weekends across all cities, months and booking platforms. Leverage this insight to increase revenue generated during weekends.

70% of the bookings are checked out while 5% of booking don’t show up across all cities and booking platforms which means 75% of bookings generate revenue for AtliQ hotels. Identify and analyze the reasons for cancellations and try to reduce them.

Avg rating varies between 3.4 to 3.8 across cities. Compare it with the industry benchmark across cities and evaluate the performance.

Occupancy rate is highest at Delhi with 60+ % for all months though generates least revenue compared to other cities. Identify the reason for higher occupancy and use that to drive the revenue growth.
